# ihs_imposter 🎭

ihs_imposter is a web-based version of the popular *Imposter* game, customized for **IHS** and designed to work **online**.  
Unlike most existing Imposter apps that require passing around one physical phone, this version allows **everyone to play on their own device** using a shared game code.

The game keeps the original gameplay but adds a school-themed twist using IHS-related words.

## 🎮 How the Game Works

1. One player creates a game and becomes the **host**.
2. The host shares a **game code** (or link) with the group.
3. Players join on their own phones or computers.
4. Each player receives:
   - the **actual word**, or
   - a **1-word hint** (making them an imposter).
5. The app randomly selects a player to go first.
6. Players take turns **clockwise**, describing the word creatively.
7. Imposters try to blend in without knowing the word.
8. At the end of the round, players **vote** for who they think the imposter is.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Imposter is a fun game that I love playing with my friends at school.  
However, every app I found only worked **in person**, since you had to pass one phone around.

I wanted to:
- Make Imposter playable **online**
- Give each player their own screen
- Add a **school-specific twist** using IHS-related words
- Learn more about **full-stack development**, especially backend systems

This project is both a fun game and a way for me to get more real coding experience.

## 🌱 Future Features

Planned features include:
- Supporting **more than 12 players**
- Player accounts and profiles
- In-game **chat**
- Turn **timers**
- Improved **voting UI**
- Better animations and transitions
- More host customization options
